	  <p>You are about to subscribe to a <a href="about:ubiquity">Ubiquity</a> command from an unknown, untrusted third-party source at <a id="targetLink"></a>. If you subscribe, this command could do <i>anything it wants</i> to your browser. It could steal your credit card number or e-mail your grandmother your entire image browsing history.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="errorLongDesc">
          <p>Here is the JavaScript source code to the command:</p>

          <div id="sourceCode"></div>

          <p>If you understand JavaScript, you should read this and
            use your best judgement to decide whether the command is
            something that's safe to execute or not. Proceed at your
            own risk!</p>

          <p>If you don't understand JavaScript, you should not
            subscribe to the command unless the link was given to you
            by someone you know and trust.</p>

          <!-- TODO: Show code fingerprint (hash+size) too. -->

            <p>In the future, we plan to have a widget here displaying
              what we call a &quot;social trust network&quot;.  You'll
              be able to see whether any of your friends have tried
              out this command.  They can either vouch for the
              command's safety or leave a warning about the command's
              dangers.  We hope this will help people make informed
              decisions about whether to subscribe to commands or not.
              This feature should be coming in Ubiquity 0.2.</p>
